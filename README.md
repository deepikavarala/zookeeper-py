# zookeeper-py
Zookeeper project in python

## Stage 1/4: Rush into print.

### Description
There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for our large zoo, so one of your employers has suggested a more convenient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being able to check on each habitat would help the zookeepers take care of our furry friends more efficiently!

In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeepers check on the animals and make sure that they're doing well. Your product will be able to process commands from the zookeepers and display the animals on a monitor.

### Objectives
To begin with, you will develop a simple printer. Your program should display the text from the output example.

## Stage 2/4: Show me an animal!

### Description
One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!

### Objectives
For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.

Please, don't remove the r character at the start of the code template. It's a part of the string and it's important. So, the string should start with r""" sequence. This “r” at the beginning stands for “raw” and allows various characters to be used in a string without escaping. For instance, “\” in a non-raw string should be escaped as follows: “\\”.

## Stage 3/4: What's inside?

### Description
The third stage requires you to increase the capabilities of your software. Now it should be able to recognize the number of a specific habitat from the input and show the animals living there.

Add all of the variables from the template to a single variable with the list type. The order of variables matters: they must appear on the list in the order in which they're defined in the code. The list must contain all of the variables with no duplicates.

### Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

1. Ask for the number of the desired habitat using the following phrase: Which habitat # do you need?

2. Use the input number as an index of your habitats to print its content.

3. End with the following phrase:
```
---
The end of the program. To check another habitat restart the watcher please.
```
